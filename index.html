                                                            comfortable in his presence. He transferred me for a small fee to the train station. I utilised the car

                                                            my return. Yes, you must leave your car key to enable vehicles to be moved about in the parking
                                                            spaces if necessary, but I had no problem whatsoever with this. I wouldn’t hesitate to use the service
                                                            provided in the future, and I would highly recommend Park Wash Go! as I honestly can’t fault any
                                                            aspect of it. Thank you for the professional, extremely reasonable service that you provide.”</p>
