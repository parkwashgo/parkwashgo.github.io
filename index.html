                                                    <p>10th April 2018</p>
                                                    <p>“As a very fussy lady, I am delighted to be able to leave an honest, pleasing review, especially
                                                        being a regular, lone lady traveller. I recently parked my car on ROHIT’s driveway on west
                                                        cliff Preston. I left my car from 3/04/2018 for 3 days parking.
                                                        I was met by Rohit at his driveway, which was easily found less than a mile from the station.
                                                        He was very kind and amiable, and I immediately felt comfortable in his presence. He
                                                        transferred me for a small fee to the train station, and you can book returns to your car if
                                                        you wish. With what I saved on parking I utilised his car valeting service. The cost was very
                                                        reasonable, and my car was in showroom condition on my return.
                                                        Yes, you must leave your car key to enable vehicles to be moved about in the parking spaces
                                                        if necessary, but I had no problem whatsoever with this. I wouldn’t hesitate to use the
                                                        service provided by Rohit in the future, and I would highly recommend him to anyone. He
                                                        deserves to succeed, and I wish him well building up this business as I honestly can’t fault
                                                        any aspect of it. Thank you, Rohit, for the professional, extremely reasonable service that
                                                        you provide.”</p>
